# skin.ftvJo
Fire TV skin for Kodi Jo fork

Original fTV skin by Hitcher: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=207475

#Important:
- Not compatible to Hitcher's official repo version, sorry
- The skin has its own skin ID. So you can keep both, Hitchers fTV and my mod. Just take care of different skin folder names.
- Current master is only tested on Leia version of Kodi


#Required addons:
- script.toolbox
- script.favourites
- script.extendedinfo
- script.globalsearch
- script.skinshortcuts
- script.artwork.downloader
- script.skin.helper.service
- script.embuary.info
- script.embuary.helper

#Recommended addons:
- fTV UI sounds by Hitcher (https://github.com/HitcherUK/resource.uisounds.ftv/archive/master.zip)



#Most important changes so far:
- increase some of the font size
- adding header to textboxviewer
- adding remaining time in hte seekbar
